# Instructions for working with MarkDown

## Text selection

## Lists

To create an unnumbered list, write at the beginning of the line (*) or (+) or (-) then a space. Examples bellow

* First element
* Second element
* Third element

+ First element
+ Second element
+ Third element

- First element
- Second element
- Third element

If we use different characters, the indentation between the lines of the list increases

* First element
* Second element
- Third element
- Fourth element
+ Fifth element
+ Sixth element

To create a numbered list, use a digit with a dot at the beginning of the line

1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element

Markdown markup also allows you to design multi-level list. The level is indicated by indentation.  It is easier not to count spaces, but to hightlight each new subparagraph with a tab. Examples bellow

1. Item 1
    1. Sub-item 1.1
        * Sub-item 1.1.a
    2. Sub-item 2.1
        1. Sub-item 2.1.1

2. Item2
    * sub-item A
        * sub-item A.a
    * sub-item B
        + sub-item B.a
        - sub-item B.b
    + sub-item C
